## Course overview

Software Engineering for Scientists is a course for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in the sciences who want to enhance their research by developing custom software. This class will build off basic programming skills to enable the development of robust and reliable software for reproducible science. These skills will sample core elements from both software engineering (e.g., version control, testing and continuous integration, debugging, benchmarking, documentation, distribution) and software design (e.g., algorithm analysis, sorting and searching, file input and output, text parsing, basic data structures), and will be organized around the ingestion and processing of data for many different scientific domains.

## Class structure

We will be flexible with the pace of topics and assignments and the choice of topics as we learn what is and is not interesting to folks. While attendance is not required, this is a hands-on class and lectures will be interactive. Supporting documents will be provided, but many details will only be covered in class. 

## Grading
### Grad Grading					
- Weekly assignments 60%		
- Final project 40%		
  - Proposal	10%
  - Code Review 10%
  - Presentation	40%
  - Content 40%

### Undergrad grading
- Weekly assignments		90%
- Final project (optional)	30% (yes, that adds up to 120)%


## Assignments

All assignments and grading will be through GitHub classroom. We will post the link to the assignment. Go to the link, accept the assignment, and clone the repository. All assignments must adhere to the Python best practices and must use the proper GitHub workflow. Unless directed otherwise, we will only consider the v1.0 release and use the date of that release as the submit time. Late assignments will not be considered. Assignments without the correct release will not be considered. You may work together on assignments, but I expect original contributions from every student. In most cases, assignments will be ***due at 5PM*** one week after they are posted.

## Project

All graduate students must propose and submit a project. Each project will have between 2 and 4 team members. A team may not have more than three graduate students. A team of 4 must have at least one undergraduate. Projects can address any scientific question and must incorporate all of the software engineering and software design topics covered in class. The question does not need to be novel, but all contributions must be original. Teams are encouraged, but not required, to meet with me about their topic. A short in-class proposal will focus on the scientific question and a longer final presentation will focus on the resulting software product and any results. Each team will perform and present a code review of another team’s code. Undergraduates are encouraged but not required to either join a team or develop their own project.

## Classroom Behavior

Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation, or political philosophy.

For more information, see the [classroom behavior policy](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior), the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct), and the [Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/).

## Requirements for Infectious Disease

Members of the CU Boulder community and visitors to campus must follow university, department, and building health and safety requirements and all applicable campus policies and public health guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases. If public health conditions require, the university may also invoke related requirements for student conduct and disability accommodation that will apply to this class.

If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19 or if you have tested positive for COVID-19, please stay home and follow the [guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for isolation and testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms and have not tested positive for COVID-19, you do not need to stay home but should follow the [guidance of the CDC for masking and testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html).

## Accommodation for Disabilities, Temporary Medical Conditions, and Medical Isolation

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu)  for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.  
If you have a required medical isolation for which you require adjustment, contact me (Erik) as soon as possible and we will come up with a plan.

## Preferred Student Names and Pronouns

CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.

## Honor Code

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/honor-code). Violations of the Honor Code may include but are not limited to: plagiarism (including use of paper writing services or technology \[such as essay bots\]), cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. 

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution: [honor@colorado.edu](mailto:honor@colorado.edu), 303-492-5550. Students found responsible for violating the [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/honor-code) will be assigned resolution outcomes from the Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution as well as be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member. Visit [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/honor-code) for more information on the academic integrity policy. 

## Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation

CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits [protected-class](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/policies/discrimination-harassment-policy/protected-class-definitions) discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, and related retaliation by or against members of our community on- and off-campus. These behaviors harm individuals and our community. The Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) addresses these concerns, and individuals who have been subjected to misconduct can contact OIEC at 303-492-2127 or email [cureport@colorado.edu](mailto:cureport@colorado.edu). Information about university policies, [reporting options](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/reporting-resolutions/making-report), and [support resources](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/support-resources) can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and graduate instructors must inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents related to these policies regardless of when or where something occurred. This is to ensure that individuals impacted receive outreach from OIEC about resolution options and support resources. To learn more about reporting and support for a variety of concerns, visit the [Don’t Ignore It](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit/) page.

## Religious Accommodations

Campus policy requires faculty to provide reasonable accommodations for students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Please communicate the need for a religious accommodation in a timely manner. In this class, I (Erik) expect students to meet with me in office hours early in the semester to make a plan.

See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.
