# Sofware Engineering for Scientists
Computer science (CS) departments have become good at teaching computer programming to students from various backgrounds and experience levels. While the primary goal of this pedagogical expansion has been to increase the diversity in CS departments, many other students have also benefited from improvements to these classes. In particular, there has been a surge of trainees wanting to learn to program to develop new software to analyze large and complex data sets. Unfortunately, there is a gap between knowing how to program and knowing how to design and implement robust and reproducible software. In particular, introductory CS classes do not cover core principles of software engineering, such as software design, construction, testing, and maintenance. Since these classes target CS students, the expectation is that students will learn these skills in subsequent upper-level courses. Non-CS students must either learn these topics on their own or, more likely, develop lower-quality software.

Software Engineering for Scientists (SWE4S) aims to bridge this gap by aggregating topics from the relevant upper-level CS classes, including algorithms, data structures, data science, and software engineering. The challenge is to select the right subset of subjects from each class and integrate them into an engaging, not overwhelming, single-semester course. To help us prioritize topics, we actively solicited input from trainees and their advisors.

This repo contains the notes and small Python and Bash scripts used in teaching Sofware Engineering for Scientists taught at CU Boulder.
