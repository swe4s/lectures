    "A common analogy is that a class is like the blueprint for a house. You can use the blueprint to create several houses and even a complete neighborhood. Each concrete house is an ***object*** or ***instance*** that’s derived from the blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some lingo: \n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP the term ***attributes*** refers to the properties or data associated with a specific object of a given class. In Python, attributes are variables defined inside a class with the purpose of storing the required data for the class to work. In the `Car` class above, `model` and `current_speed` are attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term ***methods*** refers to the different behaviors/things classes can do. Methods are functions that you define within a class. These functions typically operate on or with the attributes of the underlying instance or class. In the `Car` class above, `accelerate` is a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically,\n",
    "\n",
    "- attributes = data/variables in the class\n",
    "- methods = functions in the class\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***state*** of an object is the data or attributes held by the object at a particular moment. You use the data to define the object’s current state and the methods to operate on that data or state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action of creating concrete objects from an existing class is known as ***instantiation***. With every instantiation, you create a new object of the target class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why (and why not to) use classes and OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why classes and OOP are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intuitive Structure: OOP mirrors the way we think about the world. Objects in OOP correspond to real-world entities, making it easier to design and understand complex systems. You model a car, for example, with attributes like model and color (data) and behaviors like accelerate or brake (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity: OOP promotes breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained units (objects). Each object is responsible for a specific part of the system, which makes the program easier to manage and modify. This modularity reduces complexity and allows developers to work on different parts of a program simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Reusability: Through inheritance, OOP allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, reducing redundancy. If you have a base class, like \"Vehicle,\" you can create subclasses (e.g., \"Car\" and \"Motorcycle\") that inherit common properties and behaviors, while adding specific functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within an object, hiding the internal workings from the outside world. This prevents unintended interference and misuse, ensuring better control over how data is accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Maintainability: Because of the modular and organized nature of OOP, it's easier to maintain and update systems. If a bug or change is needed, you can often update just a single class or object without impacting the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Scalability and Flexibility: OOP systems are easier to scale, allowing new features and objects to be added without major changes to the existing codebase. You can extend functionality through polymorphism where objects of different types can be treated as instances of the same class (in some situations), e.g., sequence types like strings, lists, and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Abstraction: OOP allows developers to focus on high-level functionality without getting bogged down by lower-level details. By defining clear interfaces and abstract classes, you can create complex systems where the implementation details are hidden, reducing complexity and making collaboration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, OOP provides a clean, organized, and efficient way to write software, which is especially beneficial for large-scale, complex applications. Its principles align with the human way of thinking, making it a natural and effective approach to software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be overused and overkill at times. See [here](https://realpython.com/python-classes/#deciding-when-to-avoid-classes) for some situations in which and reasons why you might not want to use classes. Rather than relying on rules from on high, I suggest thinking about the problem at hand and coming to reasonable conclusion about whether the problem warrants packaging data with behavior. If you can explain to someone else (and yourself) why you chose to use a class, that's perfect. They may have a different opinion but reasonable minds can disagree and talk it out :)"

    "Python supports what it calls ***special methods*** which are also known as ***dunder methods*** or ***magic methods***. These methods are typically instance methods and they’re a fundamental part of Python’s internal class mechanism. The [official Python glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-special-method) says a special method is \"a method that is called implicitly by Python to execute a certain operation on a type, such as addition. Such methods have names starting and ending with double underscores\". The name \"dunder\" comes from \"double underscore\".  The `__init__()` method is probably the most common special method in Python classes. As you already know, this method works as the instance initializer. Python automatically calls it when you call a class constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods provide string representations for your objects. The `__str__()` method provides what’s known as the ***informal string representation*** of an object. This method must return a string that represents the object in a user-friendly manner. You can access an object’s informal string representation using either `str()` or `print()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__repr__()` method is similar, but it must return a string that allows you to re-create the object if possible. So, this method returns what’s known as the ***formal string representation*** of an object. This string representation is mostly targeted at Python programmers, and it’s pretty useful when you’re working in an interactive REPL session (\"REPL\" stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that reads user inputs (expressions or commands), evaluates them, prints the results, and then loops back to read the next input. In Python, the REPL is the interactive Python shell you get when you type python or python3 in your terminal). "
